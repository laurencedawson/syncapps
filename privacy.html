	<center><h1>Privacy Policy</h1></center>
	
	<p>This privacy policy is for the apps “reddit sync” and “reddit sync pro” for Android and will be referred to as “apps” for the rest of the policy.</p>
	
	<h2>Data Collection</h2>
	<p>By default the apps have Google Analytics and ACRA bug tracking enabled.</p>
	<p>Google analytics captures very broad information about the flow through the app, which sections are used and what settings are played with. No personally identifying information is tracked and this information is not sold to any third parties. The data is non confidential and may be shared. You can disable Google analytics at any point from within the settings of the apps and will no longer be tracked.</p>
	<p>If the app crashes, ACRA will collect a “stacktrace” and various non-identifying pieces of information such as Android version and phone model. This is used to identify and fix any potential bugs. This information is not sold to any third parties and is not shared. You can disable ACRA bug tracking at any point from within the settings of the apps and will no longer have your bugs tracked.</p>
	
<h2>Ad Serving</h2>
	<p>The apps allow third parties like ad networks to serve advertisements. Some ads include tracking technologies which aggregate information about your behavior on this and other site.
	Interest-based ads are selected for you according to your interests as determined by companies such as ad networks and data aggregators. These companies collect information about your online activity and use it to show you ads tailored to your interests.</p>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>The apps do not store any passwords locally for security reasons. A login “hash” is stored once a user logs in but this can be removed at any point by logging out.</p>
	<h2>Maturity</h2>
	<p>The apps are rated as “High maturity” due to showing user submitted content. More information on maturity ratings can be found on the Google Play support website: <a href="http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1075738">http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1075738</a></p>
